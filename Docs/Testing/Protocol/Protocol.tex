\section{Objective}
Explore how similar two versions of a video game are to one another based on a number of criteria including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Aesthetics
  \item Difficulty
  \item Control Scheme
  \item Overall Gameplay
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
Questionnaire presented after the playing of both games - total time ~30 minutes

\section{Preparation}

\subsection{Recruitment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Largely Facebook-based
  \item Target younger, more video-game-savvy individuals
  \item Provide incentive (prize draw to win a drink on me)
  \item Discuss an appropriate meeting place
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Required Materials}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Laptop on which to play the games
  \item Paper and writing implement with which the user can make notes about the first version upon completion of playing time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collected Data}
\begin{itemize}
  \item User's name and email address (will be destroyed on completion of prize draw)
  \item User notes on initial gameplay
  \item User-completed survey with scores and written notes on similarities/differences between games
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statistical analysis of similarity ratings
  \item Natural language analysis of similarity notes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding of how similar the games are on a purely rating level
  \item Understanding of how to make the two versions more similar
\end{itemize}
