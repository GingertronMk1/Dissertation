##Proposal Feedback
- Cite Graham Hutton's book for the FP section
- Maybe switch to Thorsten?
- Programming vs research
- Aim: gather requirements and specification to determine level of faithfulness
  - Faithful: experience vs architecture
  - Obj: user percieved faithful experience
  - In general people haven't done a lot of this sort of stuff
    - IDing mapping strategies
    - Impact on UX
    - Ideally inform further work
  - "beyond its original scope" - why? Extensibility - ADD TO MOTIVATION, add to eval.
    - Additional objectives
      - establish mapping methodology using this game
      - establish criteria for comparison of implementations
      - Conduct user study
      - Demonstrate extensibility by implementing some number of features additionally
  - Methodology
    - research best practises for 
      - spec/req
      - implementation (agile etc)
      - testing (software vs user)
  - External
    - Use as an example of porting/moving between paradigms
  - Citing
    - Things quoted in modules
    - Google Scholar

- Discuss mappings from objects to types and typeclasses
  - Interesting features, properties thereof
  - Highlight this (Haskell doesn't like thing x, here's how I worked around that)
  - Discuss things that could be exploited
- Formalise a testing plan
- Investigate other porting jobs (Doom/Quake), compare
- Discuss similarities in functionality between mine and someone else's
  - Theirs has thing x, mine also does
  - Investigate what is considered a feature
- Additional features, why Haskell's let me do that more easily
  - Clear claims on uniqueness and benefits
- ONE STEP FURTHER: user experience
  - Tricky - people focus on negatives
- Make them at least visually similar
- Depending on measurements - difference in terms of speed, difficulty, etc.
  - 2 test per person: one with the same games, one with different games
  - Ideal goal: not be able to say which game's which
  - Google Form questionnaire
- Measure properties of one game vs another
- MUST BE EXPERIENTIAL
- Numerical evaluation of properties
- Primary evaluation - done by me

- Record and make notes of known differences in testing
- PROTOCOL
  - Write down a speech to give to testees at the beginning of the test
  - Confidentiality; I don't plan on taking any data from people beyond their gradings of similarity
  - Consent form, information sheet
  - Note down experience in games for each user
  - Checklist for every test
  - Between gameplay sessions write notes about experience
  - Prelim testing testing
  - Multiple game sessions per aspect of gameplay?
- Statistical analysis
  - Combination of the two - "please explain your rating"
- Aim to get 10 people through the door
- Look at online lit regarding game comparisons
- Likert scales
- Alternate which game goes first
- Look at what factors will affect people's answers
