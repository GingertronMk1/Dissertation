##Proposal Feedback
- Cite Graham Hutton's book for the FP section
- Maybe switch to Thorsten?
- Programming vs research
- Aim: gather requirements and specification to determine level of faithfulness
  - Faithful: experience vs architecture
  - Obj: user percieved faithful experience
  - In general people haven't done a lot of this sort of stuff
    - IDing mapping strategies
    - Impact on UX
    - Ideally inform further work
  - "beyond its original scope" - why? Extensibility - ADD TO MOTIVATION, add to eval.
    - Additional objectives
      - establish mapping methodology using this game
      - establish criteria for comparison of implementations
      - Conduct user study
      - Demonstrate extensibility by implementing some number of features additionally
  - Methodology
    - research best practises for 
      - spec/req
      - implementation (agile etc)
      - testing (software vs user)
  - External
    - Use as an example of porting/moving between paradigms
  - Citing
    - Things quoted in modules
