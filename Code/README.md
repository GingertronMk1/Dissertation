# Functional Frogger

Dependencies:
- GHC 8.4.1
- cabal
- Haskell packages:
  - gloss
  - random
  - time

To build and run, navigate to this folder in your terminal and enter `cabal run`.

Within the game you may use either the WASD or arrow keys to move the Frogger.
While on the road you must avoid moving objects lest you be run over, whereas on the river the moving objects will save you from drowning.
Occupy every goal on a level with a Frogger to advance to the next level!

Good luck!
